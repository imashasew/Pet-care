I recently built a Pet Care website as a practice project using HTML & CSS to improve my design and development skills. 🐶🐾

🌟 Pages Included:
✅ Home Page – A clean and welcoming introduction
✅ About Page – Sharing details about the pet care service
✅ Services Page – Listing all available pet care services
✅ Dog Hotel Page – Special accommodations for pets
✅ Review Page – Featuring customer feedback
✅ Contact Page – Easy ways to reach out

This project helped me experiment with CSS styling, layouts, and responsiveness, enhancing my frontend development skills. Excited to keep learning and refining my designs! 💻✨
